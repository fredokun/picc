picc
the (parallel) pi-calculus compiler
====

How to use:

First, compile the sources in src/ with make.
Then, you will find some tests to run in the tests/ directory. To run a test, for example Fibonacci.pth, type (once in the tests directory):
make Fibonacci.run -> it will produce Fibonacci.run executable, run it with ./Fibonacci.run

If you want to get the Fibonacci.c, type make Fibonacci.c instead.


Enjoy.
